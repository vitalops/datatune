Perform transformations on your data with natural language using LLMs

## Installation

```bash
pip install datatune
```

From source:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## üöÄ Quick Start
```python
import os
import dask.dataframe as dd

import datatune as dt
from datatune.llm.llm import OpenAI

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-api-key"

# Set tokens-per-minute and requests-per-minute limits 
llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", tpm = 200000, rpm = 50)

# Load data from your source with Dask
df = dd.read_csv("tests/test_data/products.csv")
print(df.head())

# Transform data with Map
mapped = dt.map(
    prompt="Extract categories from the description and name of product.",
    output_fields=["Category", "Subcategory"],
    input_fields = ["Description","Name"] # Relevant input fields (optional)
)(llm, df)

# Filter data based on criteria
filtered = dt.filter(
    prompt="Keep only electronics products",
    input_fields = ["Name"] # Relevant input fields (optional)
)(llm, mapped)

# Get the final dataframe after cleanup of metadata and deleted rows after operations using `finalize`.
result = dt.finalize(filtered)
result.compute().to_csv("electronics_products.csv")

new_df = dd.read_csv("electronics_products.csv")
print(new_df.head())
```

**products.csv**
```
   ProductID             Name   Price  Quantity                                        Description      SKU

1       1002     Office Chair   89.99        75  Comfortable swivel office chair with lumbar su...  OC-2002
2       1003       Coffee Mug    9.49       300                  Ceramic mug, 12oz, microwave safe  CM-3003

```

**electronics_products.csv**
```
   Unnamed: 0  ProductID               Name  ...      SKU     Category           Subcategory
0           0       1001     Wireless Mouse  ...  WM-1001  Electronics  Computer Accessories
1           3       1004    LED Monitor 24"  ...  LM-2404  Electronics              Monitors
2           6       1007     USB-C Cable 1m  ...  UC-7007  Electronics                Cables
3           8       1009  Bluetooth Speaker  ...  BS-9009  Electronics                 Audio
```

If you don't set `rpm` or `tpm`, Datatune will automatically look up default limits for your model from our [model_rate_limits](datatune/llm/model_rate_limits.py). If model is not available in the lookup dictionary rpm and tpm will default to **gpt-3.5-turbo** limits.

Passing `input_fields` reduces the number of tokens sent by sending only relevant columns as input to the given LLM API, hence reducing the cost.

## Features

### üï∂Ô∏è Example 1: Data Anonymization

Protect sensitive information while preserving data utility:

```python
# Anonymize personally identifiable information
customer_data = dd.read_csv("customer_records.csv")
anonymized = dt.map(
    prompt="Replace all personally identifiable fields with XX - emails, phone numbers, names, addresses",
    output_fields=["anonymized_text"],
    input_fields=["customer_notes"]
)(llm, customer_data)
```

**Output:**
```
   CustomerID                           Original_Notes                    Anonymized_Text
0        3001    "John Smith called about bill"         "XX called about bill"
1        3002    "Email: jane@email.com for updates"   "Email: XX for updates"
2        3003    "Call 555-1234 regarding order"       "Call XX regarding order"
```

### üè∑Ô∏è Example 2: Data Classification

Extract and categorize information:

```python
# Classify customer support emails by department and urgency
support_emails = dd.read_csv("support_emails.csv")
classified = dt.map(
    prompt="Classify emails by department (Technical/Billing/Sales) and urgency level (Low/Medium/High/Critical)",
    output_fields=["department", "urgency_level", "estimated_response_time"],
    input_fields=["subject", "email_body"]
)(llm, support_emails)
```

**Output:**
```
   EmailID                    Subject         Department  Urgency_Level  Estimated_Response_Time
0     4001    "Login issues on mobile"      Technical        High              "2 hours"
1     4002    "Invoice payment question"   Billing          Medium            "1 day"  
2     4003    "Server completely down"     Technical        Critical          "30 minutes"
```

### üîç Example 3: Smart Filtering

Filter to remove rows based on criteria:

```python
# Filter high-quality product reviews
reviews = dd.read_csv("reviews.csv")
quality_reviews = dt.filter(
    prompt="Keep only genuine, detailed reviews that are not spam",
    input_fields=["review_text", "reviewer_history"]
)(llm, reviews)
```

**Output:**
```
   ReviewID                           Review_Text              Reviewer_History    Rating
0      5001    "Excellent product, works as expected..."    "50+ reviews, verified"   5
1      5004    "Good value for money, fast shipping..."     "25+ reviews, verified"   4  
2      5007    "Quality exceeded my expectations..."        "15+ reviews, verified"   5
```

### üó∫Ô∏è Map Operation

Transform data with natural language:

```python
customers = dd.read_csv("customers.csv")
mapped = dt.map(
    prompt="Extract country and city from the address field",
    output_fields=["country", "city"]
)(llm, customers)
```

### üîç Filter operation

```python
# Filter to remove rows
filtered = dt.filter(
    prompt="Keep only customers who are from Asia"
)(llm, mapped)
```

### ü§ù Multiple LLM Support

Datatune works with various LLM providers with the help of LiteLLM under the hood:

```python
# Using Ollama
from datatune.llm.llm import Ollama
llm = Ollama()

# Using Azure
from datatune.llm.llm import Azure
llm = Azure(
    model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    api_key=api_key,
    api_base=api_base,
    api_version=api_version)

# OpenAI
from datatune.llm.llm import OpenAI
llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo")
```

### ü§ñ Agents

Datatune provides an agentic interface that allows large language models (LLMs) to autonomously plan and execute data transformation steps using natural language prompts. Agents understand your instructions and dynamically generate the appropriate sequence of Map, Filter, and other operations on your data ‚Äî no need to manually compose transformation chains.

#### ‚úÖ How It Works

With just a single prompt, the agent analyzes your intent, determines the necessary transformations, and applies them directly to your Dask DataFrame.

```
import datatune as dt
from datatune.llm.llm import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", tpm=200000)

# Create a Datatune Agent
agent = dt.Agent(llm)

# Define your transformation task
prompt = "Add a new column called ProfitMargin = (Total Profit / Total Revenue) * 100."

# Let the agent handle it!
df = agent.do(prompt, df)
result = dt.finalize(df)
```

#### üß† Intelligent Operation Selection

The agent automatically infers the right operations for the job:

* Column creation: Derive new columns using arithmetic, string manipulation, or semantic understanding.
* Conditional filtering: Keep or drop rows based on complex logic.
* Semantic classification: Categorize data based on textual cues or domain knowledge.
* Multi-step pipelines: Chain multiple transformations from a single prompt.

#### üìÅ Examples

##### 1. Add Derived Metrics

```python
prompt = "Add a new column called ProfitMargin = (Total Profit / Total Revenue) * 100."
df = agent.do(prompt, df)
```

‚úÖ Adds the column, infers data types, and inserts it in-place.

##### 2. Classify and Filter in One Go

```python
prompt = "Create a new column called Category and Sub-Category based on the Industry column and only keep organizations that are in Africa."
df = agent.do(prompt, df)
```

‚úÖ Categorizes based on industry and filters by region ‚Äî all in a single command.

##### 3. Extract and Filter Rows

```python
prompt = "Extract year from date of birth column into a new column called Year and keep only people who are in STEM related jobs."
df = agent.do(prompt, df)
```

‚úÖ Extracts the year, identifies STEM professions, and filters accordingly.

##### üèÅ Finalizing Agent Results

After the agent has performed its tasks, finalize the dataframe to apply clean-up and remove intermediate metadata:
```
result = dt.finalize(df)
result.compute().to_csv("output.csv", index=False)
```

Agents make Datatune ideal for non-technical users, rapid prototyping, and intelligent data workflows ‚Äî just describe what you want, and let the agent do the rest.

### üß© Data Compatibility

Datatune leverages Dask DataFrames to enable scalable processing across large datasets. This approach allows you to:

- Process data larger than context length of LLMs
- Execute parallel computations efficiently

If you're working with pandas DataFrames, convert them with a simple:

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd
dask_df = dd.from_pandas(pandas_df, npartitions=4)  # adjust partitions based on your data size
```
